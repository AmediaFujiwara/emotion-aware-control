# Emotion-Aware Stability-First Control

This repository contains a personal research framework for
emotion-based, stability-first decision and control.

The core idea is to treat human emotions not as noise,
but as **risk signals** indicating possible system failure
in life, work, finance, and social environments.

This project is maintained privately by "Amedia" and is not affiliated
with any organization.

## Core Contributions

This work proposes three main contributions:

### 1. Structural Risk Vector
Emotional states are translated into a 3-dimensional structural vector:

**R = [b, u, l]**

- **b**: Boundary Violation  
- **u**: Uncontrollability  
- **l**: Loss / Anticipated Loss  

This vector is not for labeling emotions, but for identifying
which part of a system should be redesigned.

### 2. Stability-First Control Loop
Decision making is modeled as a feedback control system:

Emotion → Meta-cognition → Structural Identification → Policy Design → Stability

Intervention types:
- **Env** (environment)
- **Inst** (institutions / rules)
- **Proc** (procedures)
- **NI** (non-intervention)

---

### 3. Non-Intervention (NI) as a Safety Mechanism
NI is explicitly defined as a control policy that prevents
over-intervention when:
- uncontrollability is high
- intervention cost is high

This acts as a **safety valve** for the control system.

## Status

This is a private research repository used to maintain and refine
a stability-first decision framework.

Public release may or may not happen in the future.
